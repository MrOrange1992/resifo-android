##Postmortem

A big problem was time management, we never thought that getting started takes us so much longer than expected.
First it was also difficult to define clear roles in the team, but it got better and better.
Furthermore, the programming language became a problem because you do not find many tutorials for Scala.
Therefore, we mixed Java and Scala code in our project.
We learned a lot about teamwork and how it is possible to organize a project on git hub when working with more people.
Of course, we made progress in programming and found out how stressful it can be.
